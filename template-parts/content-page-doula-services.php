Our team has personally met with several local care providers and the staff at our area hospitals to collaborate on making you the center of this experience. The providers in our area have been very welcoming and we look forward to the positive impact this will have on our clients.<br>
  				&nbsp;
  				<p>Your care provider and nurse are focused on a healthy mother and healthy baby. Your doula is focused on  your goals and desires for this birth.  You can take comfort in knowing your providers and your doula share the same goal of making your birth experience the best it can be. We specialize in unbiased support for all birthing choices. Your doula is there to support you and educate you on your choices so you feel empowered, strong and capable of deciding what is best for you and your baby. No matter what you decide for your birth, your doula will be there encouraging you and your partner.<br></p>
  			<p><strong>You can expect your doula team to:</strong></p>

				<li><strong>Provide two postpartum visits:</strong></li>
					<ul style= "list-style-type:circle">
						<li>The first will be with your Labor doula, and is usually scheduled around day three. In this visit we <i>ooh</i> and <i>ahh</i> over your beautiful baby, check on the well being of you, your baby and the new family, discuss your birth and assess any ongoing postpartum needs.</li>
